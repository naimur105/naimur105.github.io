**Book Review: Lost in Time by A.G. Riddle**

I literaly picked up *Lost in Time* because of its cover! The title sounded intriguing, and the artwork was so beautiful that I couldn't resist. Definitely A+ marketing there. And, within the first two pages, I was hooked. The mystery sucked me right in, kind of like the feeling you get from a Dan Brown novel.

If you’re a gamer, you'll know what I mean when I say this book feels like that game you’ve been playing for hours. It’s not the best game you've ever played, but you’re fully invested. You’ve got that "just one more level" thing going, even as your mom’s yelling at you. You’re getting dizzy, but you can't stop.

The mysteries in the story don’t get resolved until almost the very end, around 97% in, so the suspense really builds up. The language was super comfortable, which makes the story flow well without any struggle to follow along. 

If you enjoyed the TV show [Dark](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856/), you’ll probably love [Lost in Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60522318-lost-in-time).
