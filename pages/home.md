### Welcome!

From the academic side, Naimur is about to complete his Master's in Physics. Since 2022, He has been doing computational research on energy materials and their applications on solar cells. Nowadays, he is more into nuclear physics and radiation detectors. He plans to develop efficient organic scintillators that can overcome their shortcomings. Currently, he is learning the particle transport code Geant4 for detector research.
