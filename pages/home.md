### Welcome!

Naimur has recently completed his Master's in Physics. Since 2022, He has been doing computational research on energy materials and their applications on photovoltaics. In addition, his current interests are radiation detection and measurement. He plans to develop efficient organic scintillators and semiconductor photo-multipliers that can overcome their shortcomings.
